How to run:
Please type into your terminal the following code:

npm install - This runs the npm install command which allows you to run the application
npm start -  This starts the expo developer tools which you can use to run the app.

If you want to run the app on your phone you need to download the Expo Go app onto your phone from your respective app store. Using the development tools you accessed using npm start you will be able to scan a QR code using the app in order to run/test the app in its current state.

This is the updated version of the Stedi Balance app with added login functionallity. Currently the user can recive a code through the api via text, but logging in itself does not work. Further development allowing for using login will be need and required before launch

Currently the user inputs a phone number and gets a code. Once they get the code they input the code that they recived on their phone into the login screen which allows them to login.
